    "- When training a model, a common way of organizing your code is to use one graph for training your model, and **a separate graph for evaluating or performing inference with a trained model**. In many cases, the inference graph will be different from the training graph: for example, techniques like dropout and batch normalization use different operations in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- by default utilities like `tf.train.Saver` use the names of tf.Variable objects (which have names based on an underlying tf.Operation) to identify each variable in a saved checkpoint. When programming this way, you can either use completely separate Python processes to build and execute the graphs, or you can use multiple graphs in the same process.\n",
    "- TensorFlow provides a \"default graph\" that is implicitly passed to all API functions in the same context.\n",
    "- A tf.Graph defines the namespace for tf.Operation objects: each operation in a single graph must have a unique name. TensorFlow will \"uniquify\" the names of operations by appending \"_1\", \"_2\", and so on to their names if the requested name is already taken. Using multiple explicitly created graphs gives you more control over what name is given to each operation.\n",
    "- The default graph stores information about every tf.Operation and tf.Tensor that was ever added to it. If your program creates a large number of unconnected subgraphs, it may be more efficient to use a different tf.Graph to build each subgraph, so that unrelated state can be garbage collected."
